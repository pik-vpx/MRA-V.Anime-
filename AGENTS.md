# AGENTS.md - MRA Anime Edition

## Build Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint (25 pre-existing errors, mostly `any` types)

## Tech Stack
React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion, Electron

## Known Issues (Pre-existing)
- 25 lint errors (mostly `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`)
- Settings.tsx: `loadDevices` used before declared (React hook order)
- api.ts: `romajiTitle` scope issue at line 359 (fixed in this session)

## Critical: AnimeThemes Image Fetching
In `src/lib/api.ts`, `fetchAnimeThemesImage()` uses a 2-step approach:
1. `?q=${animeName}` - General search gets first result's slug
2. `filter[slug]=${slug}&include=images` - Reliable slug-based image lookup

This replaced the broken `filter[name]=` exact-match which failed ~46% of the time.

## Architecture
- `src/App.tsx` - Main React UI (457 lines)
- `src/lib/api.ts` - Shazam + Anime matching + Lyrics APIs
- `src/lib/audio.ts` - Mic/desktop audio recording
- `src/components/Settings.tsx` - Settings page
- `electron/` - Electron main + preload scripts

# Everything Claude Code (ECC) — Agent Instructions

This is a **production-ready AI coding plugin** providing 48 specialized agents, 183 skills, 79 commands, and automated hook workflows for software development.

**Version:** 1.10.0

## Core Principles

1. **Agent-First** — Delegate to specialized agents for domain tasks
2. **Test-Driven** — Write tests before implementation, 80%+ coverage required
3. **Security-First** — Never compromise on security; validate all inputs
4. **Immutability** — Always create new objects, never mutate existing ones
5. **Plan Before Execute** — Plan complex features before writing code

## Agent Orchestration

Use agents proactively without user prompt:
- Complex feature requests → **planner**
- Code just written/modified → **code-reviewer**
- Bug fix or new feature → **tdd-guide**
- Architectural decision → **architect**
- Security-sensitive code → **security-reviewer**
- Autonomous loops / loop monitoring → **loop-operator**
- Harness config reliability and cost → **harness-optimizer**

Use parallel execution for independent operations — launch multiple agents simultaneously.

## Security Guidelines

**Before ANY commit:**
- No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- All user inputs validated
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- CSRF protection enabled
- Authentication/authorization verified
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Error messages don't leak sensitive data

**Secret management:** NEVER hardcode secrets. Use environment variables or a secret manager. Validate required secrets at startup. Rotate any exposed secrets immediately.

**If security issue found:** STOP → use security-reviewer agent → fix CRITICAL issues → rotate exposed secrets → review codebase for similar issues.

## Coding Style

**Immutability (CRITICAL):** Always create new objects, never mutate. Return new copies with changes applied.

**File organization:** Many small files over few large ones. 200-400 lines typical, 800 max. Organize by feature/domain, not by type. High cohesion, low coupling.

**Error handling:** Handle errors at every level. Provide user-friendly messages in UI code. Log detailed context server-side. Never silently swallow errors.

**Input validation:** Validate all user input at system boundaries. Use schema-based validation. Fail fast with clear messages. Never trust external data.

**Code quality checklist:**
- Functions small (<50 lines), files focused (<800 lines)
- No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- Proper error handling, no hardcoded values
- Readable, well-named identifiers

## Testing Requirements

**Minimum coverage: 80%**

Test types (all required):
1. **Unit tests** — Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration tests** — API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E tests** — Critical user flows

**TDD workflow (mandatory):**
1. Write test first (RED) — test should FAIL
2. Write minimal implementation (GREEN) — test should PASS
3. Refactor (IMPROVE) — verify coverage 80%+

Troubleshoot failures: check test isolation → verify mocks → fix implementation (not tests, unless tests are wrong).

## Development Workflow

1. **Plan** — Use planner agent, identify dependencies and risks, break into phases
2. **TDD** — Use tdd-guide agent, write tests first, implement, refactor
3. **Review** — Use code-reviewer agent immediately, address CRITICAL/HIGH issues
4. **Capture knowledge in the right place**
   - Personal debugging notes, preferences, and temporary context → auto memory
   - Team/project knowledge (architecture decisions, API changes, runbooks) → the project's existing docs structure
   - If the current task already produces the relevant docs or code comments, do not duplicate the same information elsewhere
   - If there is no obvious project doc location, ask before creating a new top-level file
5. **Commit** — Conventional commits format, comprehensive PR summaries

## Workflow Surface Policy

- `skills/` is the canonical workflow surface.
- New workflow contributions should land in `skills/` first.
- `commands/` is a legacy slash-entry compatibility surface and should only be added or updated when a shim is still required for migration or cross-harness parity.

## Git Workflow

**Commit format:** `<type>: <description>` — Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

**PR workflow:** Analyze full commit history → draft comprehensive summary → include test plan → push with `-u` flag.

## Architecture Patterns

**API response format:** Consistent envelope with success indicator, data payload, error message, and pagination metadata.

**Repository pattern:** Encapsulate data access behind standard interface (findAll, findById, create, update, delete). Business logic depends on abstract interface, not storage mechanism.

**Skeleton projects:** Search for battle-tested templates, evaluate with parallel agents (security, extensibility, relevance), clone best match, iterate within proven structure.

## Performance

**Context management:** Avoid last 20% of context window for large refactoring and multi-file features. Lower-sensitivity tasks (single edits, docs, simple fixes) tolerate higher utilization.

**Build troubleshooting:** Use build-error-resolver agent → analyze errors → fix incrementally → verify after each fix.

## Project Structure

```
agents/          — 48 specialized subagents
skills/          — 183 workflow skills and domain knowledge
commands/        — 79 slash commands
hooks/           — Trigger-based automations
rules/           — Always-follow guidelines (common + per-language)
scripts/         — Cross-platform Node.js utilities
mcp-configs/     — 14 MCP server configurations
tests/           — Test suite
```

`commands/` remains in the repo for compatibility, but the long-term direction is skills-first.

## Success Metrics

- All tests pass with 80%+ coverage
- No security vulnerabilities
- Code is readable and maintainable
- Performance is acceptable
- User requirements are met

## Cross-Platform Support

### Package Manager Detection

The plugin automatically detects your preferred package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun) with the following priority:

1. **Environment variable**: `CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER`
2. **Project config**: `.claude/package-manager.json`
3. **package.json**: `packageManager` field
4. **Lock file**: Detection from package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb
5. **Global config**: `~/.claude/package-manager.json`
6. **Fallback**: First available package manager

To set your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Via environment variable
export CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER=pnpm

# Via global config
node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --global pnpm
```

### Hook Runtime Controls

Use runtime flags to tune strictness or disable specific hooks temporarily:

```bash
# Hook strictness profile (default: standard)
export ECC_HOOK_PROFILE=standard

# Comma-separated hook IDs to disable
export ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS="pre:bash:tmux-reminder,post:edit:typecheck"
```

## Dashboard

Launch the desktop dashboard to visually explore ECC components:

```bash
npm run dashboard
# or
python3 ./ecc_dashboard.py
```

**Features:**
- Tabbed interface: Agents, Skills, Commands, Rules, Settings
- Dark/Light theme toggle
- Font customization (family & size)
- Search and filter across all components
